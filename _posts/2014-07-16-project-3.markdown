description: During the Hackathon event held in the year 2019, Me along with my team proposed an idea for audio moderation service on TV by censoring profanity in subtitles and audio for family/kids viewing. Once this mode is turned on, the TV would automatically mute itself for the time being profanity words are sopken on the movies/TV shows being played. Due to the fast implementation of the above on-device, we were awarded 2nd among ~150 other proposed ideas/POC held at Samsung-Delhi.
